                        <p>Abstract: 
                            The condition of women in any society is the true indicator of its socio-economic, cultural, religious, and spiritual level. The status of women in a society is directly linked with its economic position and the level of participation in economic life which, on its own depends on rights, roles, and opportunities for participation in economic activities, Women comprise nearly fifty percent of the total population. If we neglect this force, then we are utilizing only fifty percent of the workforce. Women form an essential factor in the development of any community. We as a society cannot think to build and shape the fortunes of any country without recognizing and appreciating the role and status of women. Rural women play a key role in supporting their families, and communities and spend extra time than urban women on family work, such as time spent for attaining food, nutrition security, obtaining water and fuel, caring for children and the sick, and processing food. and culturally assigned roles that seriously restrict women`s participation in employment opportunities, producing. This study identifies challenges related to sociocultural barriers, economic disparities, rural-urban divide, awareness gaps, and gender bias. Societal expectations restrict women's employment and empowerment, while economic disparities limit their access to resources. In rural areas, women face a lack of awareness about rights and opportunities that hinders progress. The research paper emphasizes the significance of rural women's condition in society as a true indicator of its socioeconomic, cultural, religious, and spiritual level. It highlights that the status of rural women is directly linked to their economic position and their level of participation in economic activities.

                        To fulfil the increased nutrient needs of the growing infant, four weaning foods based on rice, wheat, maize and ragi have been prepared. Greengram, groundnuts and gingerly seeds were selected from pulse, and nuts and oilseeds groups respectively to supplements the weaning foods with many important nutrients. The level of protein, iron, phosphorous, thiamine and niacian was above the adequate level in all four weaning foods whereas no weaning food met the adequate fat and vitamin A level. The levels of calcium and riboflavin in ragi- based weaning food were sufficiently good.

A multi-stage random sampling technique was used in selecting 10 NGOs from Bhagalpur district of Bihar State for the purpose. Purposive sampling technique was applied for selecting the personnel. A total number of 10 NGOs were undertaken for the study, Five personnel were selected from each NGO for the purpose of the study. The total personnel included in the sample were 50. Data were collected with the use of structured interview schedule. Frequency, percentage and mean scores were used in analyzing the data. Findings indicated that the majority of the personnel were of young age group i.e. 60 percent. The involvement of the personnel was assessed on a four point continuum scale in which the mean performance score attained was 3.3. Limited access to training and skill acquisition was considered as constraints in performing job by the maximum number of respondents (72%).

                    <p>Abstract 
                        Bee–keeping practices play a vital role and adoption of beekeeping as a business has increased significantly in recent years, owing to greater people awareness of the benefits of beekeeping. Although a vast number of people pursue the occupation as a primary or secondary career, the majority of them started without a formal education. They are unable to maximise their earnings from this occupation due to a lack of or insufficient knowledge about beekeeping. To begin any endeavour, it is critical to have a thorough understanding of all aspects. In this way, training is a major catalytic force for increasing human productivity in all areas of growth. Bihar is India's fourth-largest honey-producing state, accounting for roughly 9% of total honey production. The state has a favourable temperature for beekeeping, as well as a great quantity of flowering plants and trees. Bihar's largest honey-producing districts are Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, and Samastipur. The district of Samastipur was selected on purpose. The district was selected on purpose because it is close to the Apicultural Research and Training Centre (ARTC), RPCAU, Pusa, the study was conducted in Pusa, Kalyanpur and Waarisnagar Block selected purposively. The 60 experimental group and 50 control group beekeepers were selected randomly. Thus, a total 120 respondents were interviewed for this study. The experimental group beekeepers had a mean score of 37.38, while the control group beekeepers had a score of 14.60. The t-value of 16.519 is highly significant. This table clearly shows that experimental group beekeepers had much higher levels of adoption than Control group beekeepers. Keywords: Adoption, beekeeping, experimental group, control group.</p>

                        Feminism is a critical social movement that challenges and ultimately aims to breakdown, the patriarchal structures of society. It means different things to different people at different times and has many overlaps, for example, the suffrage movement and the right to inheritance have been central themes at different times. Women have been identified as key agents of sustainable development since times immemorial and women’s equality and empowerment are seen as central to a more holistic approach for establishing new patterns and processes of sustainable development. Women account for nearly half of India's overall population. However, gender inequality and discrimination are the main characteristics of Indian society. They have been deprived of equal rights for centuries. Women, in general, are afflicted and their social conditions are deplorable. Women in our society have been the victims of humiliation, torture, and exploitation irrespective of the fact that they were also worshiped. A variety of social ills have resulted in the deprivation of women. In modern India, however, some improvement has taken place in the status of women.For improvement of women’s status human rights awareness acts as a catalyst to effect of positive changes among urban women.

                        India is the center of diverse food cultures comprising more than 1000 major and minor ethnic fermented and no fermented foods. One of the key players in ethnic foods which have been locally and globally marketed is papad. Papad, a low moisture traditional Indian savory food item is consumed either after frying or roasting. It is being manufactured on cottage or home scale and has been in a great demand in India and abroad. Traditionally, circular in shape, made from dough of powdered pulses (black gram, green gram), spices, common salt, edible oil, papad khar, containing sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate and calcium propionate. Conventionally papads making method involves preparation of dough using urid, spices, common salt, papad khar, edible oil etc. with required quality of water, beating of dough tip soft, making dough rounds (ball) rolling into circular disc, using rolling pins (roller manually). The rolled papad (circular dough disc) are dried under shade to a moisture content of 13 to 14 per cent (w.b.). Traditional method of rolling with pins (roller) is a very tedious and time consuming; hence yield of papad was also very low. Keeping the aforesaid view, the hand operated papad press available in the department of P.H.T. at C.A.E., Pusa, Bihar was planned to evaluate the Papad making prcess . This machine is faster, simple in operation and very efficient; its capacity is 150 papads per hour. Since it is very easy to operate, so ladies can also operate without any difficulty. Its production is four times greater than old system and it requires no power. Thus, the machine (hand papad press) can be used efficiently for the production of papads by village women and can generate income as well as employment to many unemployed youth at village level.

                        Women’s empowerment is the single most important factor in contributing to equality between women and men. In this paper, an attempt is made to explore the determinants that have an influence on women empowerment in Bhagalpur District of Bihar. Sample consisted 200 women beneficiaries of 10 NGOs of Bhagalpur district. The factor analysis was performed on ten (10) variables to identify the influencing factors on empowerment. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the relationship between the empowerment factors and the impact of independent variables. The empirical results showed that that Age (X1), Marital Status (X3), Annual Income (X5), Mass Media (X6), Social participation (X7), and Constraints (X9) had significant association with empowerment of women at 1 percent level of probability and negative and significant relationship between caste (x2) and participation (x10). The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that co-efficient of determination (R2) was 0.6651 which was found to be highly significant (F=37.54). Path coefficient analysis was attempted to know the direct and indirect effects through other related variables apportioning the correlation coefficient and it was found that direct effect of marital status (0.4736), age (0.2825) and annual income (0.18822) was substantial.

                        The present investigation was undertaken in Bhagalpur district of Bihar State to examine constraints faced by NGOs in empowering the rural women. It has been endeavoured to find out what and how the NGOs go through in their drive towards empowering the rural women. Empowerment of women has been conceptualized as creating in the rural women the capacity and ability to be economically productive and socially capable so as to fit and suit in the society fully as well as compete favourably with men in different aspects of life. A multi-stage random sampling technique was used in selecting 10 NGOs from Bhagalpur district of Bihar State. Data were collected with the use of structured interview schedule. Frequency counts, percentage and mean score were used in analysing the data. Findings indicated that the major constraints faced by the NGOs in exercising their role of empowering rural women were grants not released in time (90.0%), insufficient allocation of fund (80.0%), difficulty in getting full time volunteers (80%), non- availability of fund for the desired activity (80.0%), Government’s unawareness about difficulties of NGOs (80.0%), difficulty in getting qualified workers (70.0%) and Government’s indifference to problems of the NGOs.
